Yocto Project meta-hellodemo Demonstration Layer

Dependencies: This layer was written and tested with the Yocto Project
"Denzil" release, 7.0.1.

This layer is a simple example of how you might create a Yocto Project
layer to launch a simple console application when X boots up.

The hellodemo-image image recipe is derived from our core-image-sato
reference image, and includes the GNU Hello program, as well as xterm
and its associated dependencies. I also included psplash to give us
a pleasant looking boot-up screen.

Note that the demo application is launched via the matchbox session
file, which we deploy a customized version of into root's home
directory. There are potentially other ways you can launch an
application at startup depending on your goals - this method was
chosen for its simplicity.

A note about security - a "real" embedded product should not run its
main GUI or application software as root, but rather as an unprivileged
user. So don't do that! This layer is for educational purposes only.
